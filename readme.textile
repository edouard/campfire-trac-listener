h1 Introduction
If you are using "trac":http://trac.edgewall.org/ and you want to display ticket changes on "Campfire":http://www.campfirenow.com/ here is a handy <strike>hack</strike> plugin.

Here is a juicy screenshot demonstrating how it looks like.

If you'd rather use IRC instead of Campfire you might want to try out the handy "irccat":http://github.com/RJ/irccat/tree/master which is "notoriously used by the Last.fm development teams":http://www.metabrew.com/article/how-we-use-irc-at-lastfm/ instead. This Campfire plugin is actually only a slight change from the irccat trac plugin.

h1 Installation
So here’s the gist. You will need to install "Pinder":http://dev.oluyede.org/pinder/doc.html, a Campfire listener written in Python. It should be as easy as:

<pre>$ easy_install pinder</pre>

Then download or <code>git clone</code> the "Campfire trac listener plugin on github":http://github.com/edouard/campfire-trac-listener/tree/master.

You will need to have "setuptools":http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools installed. (To install setuptools, download the bootstrap module "ez_setup.py":http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and execute: <code>$ python ez_setup.py</code>)

Next, go to the <code>campfire-trac-listener</code> directory that you've just created with your <code>git clone</code> and run <code>python ./setup.py install</code>.

If this installs successfully, you are ready to begin configuration.

h1 Configuration
Put the following into your <code>trac.ini</code> file:
<code>
[campfire]
prefix = Project Name (Typically)
path = /projects/project
trachost = trac.yourhost.com
subdomain = campfire_subdomain
apitoken = yourCampfireAPIToken
roomid = RoomID
</code>
You can find your room ID at the tail end of the URL when you are in your chat room.

Add the following to the <code>[components]</code> section:

<code>campfirelistener.* = enabled</code>
